## 📋 About

This application is based around the ideia of **exercise gamification**, especialy for those who spend a lot of time sitting in front of a computer working. 

Using the *Pomodoro's rule*, each user will have 25 minutes to work focused and after that time runs out, an alert is going to sound warning about a new available exercise in order to make a small pause. This "challenge", if completed, can grant some experience points (XP) for the user to achieve new levels.  

The deployed version can be found [here](https://moveit-pi-lake.vercel.app/) for testing.
